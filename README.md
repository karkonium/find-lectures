# online-lectures
I found a way to access university lectures. It's pretty simple, just a changing some params in a link (the link was hard to find but other than that pretty easy).
So I wrote some code to find all of the lectures I can access through this link pattern.

# future plan
This could be very useful, since it finds the links to courses that were web-optioned in the past. Especailly, since some profs in my university have decided not to have a lecture component to online course. It'd be very helpful during the pandemic. I'm thinking that I'll make a full web app around this.

# current hurdle
Currently, investigating whether it's legal to do so or not. Here's where I'm conflicted, while the university is hosting the lectures (so I'm not posting copyrighted material), the main link that I use to find the lectures isn't something that the university posted (this could be a case of [Unauthorized Use of Computer]). In my mind, I'm simply going to provide protected links to university resources and [inline linking to copyrighted material isn't illegal], but I'm not really sure.
